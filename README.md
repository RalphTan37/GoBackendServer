    The purpose of this project is to practice and enhance my interest in Golang.<br />

Building a Backend Server from scratch on a local machine in Go!

Purpose:<br /> 
    To aggregate data from RSS (Really Simple Syndiation) Feeds - protocol that makes distribution easy
        (such as podcasts and blog posts).<br />
    The server will allow users to add different RSS feeds to its database and then automatically collect all of the posts from those feeds,<br /> download them, and save them in the database - so they can be viewed later.

CURRENTLY STILL WORKING ON
